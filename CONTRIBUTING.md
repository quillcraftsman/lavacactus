# Developer Guidelines

## How to report an issue

* You can find all the project issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/quillcraftsman/lavacactus/issues)
* If you found a bug, you can [create new issue](https://github.com/quillcraftsman/lavacactus/issues/new) with the bug label

## How to write a code

First you can check [existing issues](https://github.com/quillcraftsman/lavacactus/issues). Pick one or create your own.

* Create "Fork" of the project
* To run the project and tests see [Developer documentation](https://github.com/quillcraftsman/lavacactus/blob/master/DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION.md)
* Do some changes locally
* Create pull request to this repository (you can use git or "Contribute" button at the top of your local repository)

## How development is usually done

* Now this project is "benevolent dictatorship" and "BD" is [quillcraftsman](https://github.com/quillcraftsman)
* But if our community will be grown we can
transform repository to organization,
create a team with most involved members
and go to democracy

## Interaction with other developers

Now we use issues and comments in pull requests.

If you need something else like:
* forum 
* or realtime chat 
* mail list
* of discussions on GitHub
* 
you can [mail me](mailto:quill@craftsman.lol) and we will discuss this.
